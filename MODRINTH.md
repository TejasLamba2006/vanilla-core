## What is SMP Core?

Instead of running 10+ different plugins, SMP Core handles most of what you need for an SMP:

- **PvP Balance** - Gap limits, mace limits, enchantment caps
- **Gear Control** - Disable netherite, limit enchantments
- **Dimension Locks** - Keep Nether/End closed until you're ready
- **Mob Control** - Disable specific mobs per world with WorldGuard support
- **Server Restart** - Scheduled restarts with countdown warnings
- **QoL Features** - Infinite villager trades, one player sleep, minimap control

Everything is off by default. Turn on what you need, ignore the rest.
